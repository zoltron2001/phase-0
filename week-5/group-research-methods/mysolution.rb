# Input: source array, change to make
# Output: permanently changed source array
# Steps
# 1. find location of integers in array
# 2. IF element (at a location in array) is an integer
# 3. (THEN) add change to element (at that location)
# 4. return array

def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.each_index do |x|

    if source.at(x).is_a?(Integer)
      source[x] = source[x] + thing_to_modify
    end

  end

  source
end

# Input: source hash, change to make
# Output: permanently changed source array
# Steps
# 1. access values in hash
# 2. apply change to each value in hash
# 3. return hash

def my_hash_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)

  source.each_pair { |key, value| source[key] = value + thing_to_modify}

  return source

end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# For the array method:
# I iterated through the indices of the array using `.at(index)`,
# and used the `.is_a?(ObjectType)` to determine if the array
# element at each index was an Integer. (You can also use
#   `is_a?()` on other objects, Strings, Arrays, Hashes.)

# For the hash method:
# I used the iterator `.each_pair` (just like `.each`, but
# takes two parametersâ€” one for the key and one for value)
# to access each key-value pair in the pets hash, and added
# the modifying argument to the value (using the parameter
# for value).

# For reading through the Ruby Docs:
# GOOD LUCK. Ugh. Seriously, the docs are so dense and
# unhelpfully arranged/explained. It took me a good hour into
# this challenge to remember/figure out that you can use all the
# Object methods on Arrays, Hashes, Strings, whatever, so the
# toolbox widened considerably. (Link just in case:
# http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Object.html) I also had better
# luck understanding how other built-in methods work when bloggers
# explained it. Here are a few blogs I learned from:

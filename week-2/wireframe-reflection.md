What is a wireframe?
	A wireframe is a skeleton drawing, in our case, for a webpage. As the name implies, it’s a
	pretty plain design – often limited to thin black lines, white space, and black text (with
	default font). It’s primarily used to demonstrate website functionality and how items will be
	arranged on the page.
What are the benefits of wireframing?
	Design is a term with a lot of breadth. A wireframe is a tool designers can use to focus on a
	specific portion of their design (functionality and arrangement). Limiting thinking to visual
	\functionality and arrangement raises questions of priority (e.g. what should be most visible),
	ease of use (e.g. can users find what they need?), and display friendliness (e.g. how will this
	look on mobile?).
Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
	Yea is super dupe. I’ve been using illustrator for a few years now, and it’s nice to do
	something I’m familiar in the midst all of the learning. Opportunities for visualizing are nice
	too – easy to get caught up in ideas otherwise.
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
	Yeah, I suppose you could call it revisions. More than anything, my initial idea involved a few
	loose decisions (for example, where the navigation bar would be placed) that I didn’t decide on
	until wireframing.
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer
them?
	Most of my questions were some form of “Should I do that?” For example, I didn’t know if I
	should include the surrounding interface (for desktop the start menu/browser and for mobile a
	phone). I figured it would help figure out how much space I had to work with, but I didn’t know if that would distract from the design. I ended up just googling images of wireframes to make my decisions. And honestly, there were plenty of people that didn’t include the surrounding interface, but screw that, I like having one.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
	Well I liked using illustrator, we covered that. It’s a pretty simple design at this point, so I guess you could consider the whole thing tedious. But it’s good habit making, so I don’t have beef. Thumbs up all around.

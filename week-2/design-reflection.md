      What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

        My site’s primary purpose is to highlight my portfolio. Ideally my portfolio will be
        directly related to my employment interests. Hopefully that content will be coding heavy,
        but that will be determined by what I build while at DBC. I also have some video,
        photograph, radio segments, and education modules that I could post. However, I’m trying to
        move away from content/frontend development, so perhaps that might not be a good thing to
        highlight indefinitely.

      What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

        My target audience will be potential employers. I’d imagine their primary interests will be
        in determining whether the work I am highlighting relates to the work they’d like me to do.
        They’ll also might try to figure out if my work was made efficiently, with care, with an
        eye for users, and so on. While it is difficult to affect the content I will be hosting at
        this point (since a lot of it hasn’t been built yet), I can affect the website itself. I
        would like to be on the lookout for points of ingenuity (ways that my website can stand
        out). But wherever the ingenuity is not, I’d like to push for clean, easy to navigate
        design. I wouldn’t mind eventually adding a behind-the-scenes description of creating the
        site and the contents of it in the blog to demonstrate how I work.

      What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them
      to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several
      actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

        Primarily, I’d like users to look at my portfolio with the ability to dig deeper if
        intereste. “Digging deeper” not only applies to the work itself, but my blog, about, and
        contact information as well. So in a way I guess I’d like my work and the website itself to
        act as attractors that drive the user towards a more detailed look at me.

      What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

        This is a pretty subjective question, so I'm going to try to focus on what was new to me.
        Dedicated UX employees aren't necessarily an option for all companies. But when there is a
        longer timeframe or a bigger budget, they can take a load off of everyone else. The results
        of UX are difficult to measure. Emotions are tough to quantify, so we rely on indirect,
        qualitative measurements (for example, A/B testing and user serveys). That said, this is a
        big step away from the insulated client/developer process that was originally used to
        create systems.

      What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

        User experience design is design driven by user experience. It focuses on how "users feel
        when interfacing with a system" (What is User Experience Design, Jacob Gube). Users are the
        benefactors of what we build. If we fail to consider their perspective, then we're risking
        the success of the system itself. Sure, some users will have to put up with a crappy system
        for lack of research or marketplace competition. But otherwise poor UX/UI design will lead
        to lost revenue, lost users, and/or bad karma.

      Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

        None of this felt tedious.

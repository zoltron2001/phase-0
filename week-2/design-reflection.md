      What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

      
      What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
        My site’s primary purpose is to highlight my portfolio. Ideally my portfolio will be
        directly related to my employment interests. Hopefully that content will be coding heavy,
        but that will be determined by what I build while at DBC. I also have some video,
        photograph, radio segments, and education modules that I could post. However, I’m trying to
        move away from content/frontend development, so perhaps that might not be a good thing to
        highlight indefinitely.
      
      What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
        My target audience will be potential employers. I’d imagine their primary interests will be
        in determining whether the work I am highlighting relates to the work they’d like me to do.
        They’ll also might try to figure out if my work was made efficiently, with care, with an eye
        for users, and so on. While it is difficult to affect the content I will be hosting at this
        point (since a lot of it hasn’t been built yet), I can affect the website itself. I would
        like to be on the lookout for points of ingenuity (ways that my website can stand out). But
        wherever the ingenuity is not, I’d like to push for clean, easy to navigate design. I
        wouldn’t mind eventually adding a behind-the-scenes description of creating the site and the
        contents of it in the blog to demonstrate how I work.
      
      What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
        
        Primarily, I’d like users to look at my portfolio with the ability to dig deeper if
        intereste. “Digging deeper” not only applies to the work itself, but my blog, about, and
        contact information as well. So in a way I guess I’d like my work and the website itself to
        act as attractors that drive the user towards a more detailed look at me.

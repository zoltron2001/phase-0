        - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
            It was pretty straight forward. Beyond the <hr> tag, I didn't feel like we were asked
            to do much more than tackle the tags we were already taught. So if anything, this was
            an opportunity to work out the kinks in executing what had been learned.
        - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
            Research was really easy. There is so much material out there about HTML. It was never
            hard to come by an example. When it comes to semantics, however, I wonder how great my
            code is. It's entirely possible that although the code functions properly, it could be
            built with an eye towards future complexity or better readibility.
        - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
            We ended up catching formatting errors (lack of tabbing) early, which made cleaning up
            easy. However, there might be room for improvement here once we learn more. For one,
            we're still using the basic HTML doc type.
        - What seems good and bad about HTML?
            The double edged sword here is simplicity. It's inherently limiting since its function
            is primarily for basic, structural decisions. But that's also what I quite like about
            HTML. It forces you to think small. Too often webpages really only meant to host text
            are bogged down by flashiness. A simple baren HTML page means fast loading with little
            extra fluff. Still, one can't ignore the power of color and interactivity if used
        properly.
        - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
            Tags like <p> <ul> <li> and <h1> are pretty easy because the letters stand in for their
            names. I like to think of <hr> as human resources... like they're dividing two
            conflicting parties. <a> I think of as an "at" sign, since it refers to a link. href
            and src I've just commited to memory.

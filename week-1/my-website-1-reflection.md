## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on Github:
  Login to your Github Account
  Click the "+" icon located in the upper right portion of your screen
  Choose "create new repository"
  Give your repository a name
  Choose proper public/private and licensing options
    In our case we'll use a "Public" "MIT License"
  Click the "Create repository" button
Clone the repository locally
  Navigate to the repository
    If you can't find it:
      Click your profile image (upper right)
      "Your profile"
      Click the "Repositories" tab
      And find the repository you've just created
  Copy the "HTTPS clone URL" to you clipboard
  Open your local copy of the GitBash command-line
    Type "git clone remove-this-text-and-paste-URL-here"
    Hit enter
  You now have a local copy of your repository on Github.com

## Describe what open source means.

Open source software is software that can be run as well as altered by users. The ability for a user to alter the source code is what sets open source software aside from privately licensed software. If users see reason to alter something about the software, they can do so within licensed parameters.

## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source code certainly seems to have its place in the world. There's nothing wrong with work that occurs from economic incentives (art, soup kitchens). And other times, smart business is to give away a little to get something back (free refills for increased sales). There's no reason the same can't be applied to open source software (AdBlock).

I would have no problem with working on software that was open source if I either truly cared about the product or if it had a strong business strategy associated with it.

## Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing seems pretty important, but perhaps not something to stress over in this early of a stage. It's certainly important to protect one's work (even open source content can have licenses). A friend once told me US law has a tendency to default to the "inventor" for ownership. That idea seems to have been reaffirmed by the slideshare.net slide which says "Copyright is automatic in the US / Licenses allow others to help you." It seems counter intuitive that a copyright license could actually open up the gates for assistance, but no doubt that would be the case for public domain. However, at this stage there is so much to take in, and a peripheral understanding seems like enough while I default to the required MIT Licenses.

## What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Even though I struggled quite a bit initially, I'm finally getting the hang of the workflow. My aha moments came really gradually. Often I'd stumble on something that would work after a series of failures, and then try to figure out what I did to accomplish that. I mostly struggled to connect the macro concepts with my micro actions. For example, when a push or a pull should occur, and how the content is altered on either end of the spectrum in doing so. After a few iterations, the gap started to close. I ironed out the remaining uncertainties with a friend on Sunday morning.

## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Just stackoverflow forums for errors I was encountering. Otherwise, I justed combed, assessed, and re-assessed the provided content (this, I think is my preferred method voiding skimpy direction).

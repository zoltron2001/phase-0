How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
	
	The inspector allows you to view and alter a webpage as both a user and a developer.
	For formatting and positioning this is particularily useful since both are visual changes
	that often require percision. You might make live changes to determine a plan of action,
	and then copy changes over to your original code.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	
	Elements can be resized in a number of ways via CSS. One method might be to alter the
	height and width of the object via pixels, %, or em's.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?
Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

	Absoulte: Elements are positioned relative to their first ancestor that is also not static.
	Fixed: Elements remain in the same spot of the browser regardless of how the user scrolls.
	Static: Elements appear in the order they are written.
	Relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.

	Fixed was fine for most things. It was pretty predictable and did what I told it to. Absolute
	was tricky since I had to keep track of which objects did and didn't have positioning.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	
	Padding is the space between content (such as text) and its border. The border is the outer
	edge of an object. And the margin is like a forcefield, a space between the border something
	else (e.g. other objects, the page width).

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	
	CSS positioning is tough and finicky. I know there are multiple ways to accomplish some of
	these tasks - namely the "get creative" section. I'm glad I had to suffer for a bit on, but now
	I wish I had a big list of all the methods. It'd be really cool if certain answers were
	released after submission or after the week is over.

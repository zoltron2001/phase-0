// Eloquent JavaScript
//
// release 1
//
// Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
//
//   Near the beginning of the chapter he describes point-and-click limitations
//   while highlighting the need for programming languages. It was a nice bit of
//   perspective to think of language as a tool. Also while I knew Java and JS are
//   wildly different, I didn't realize the naming had to do with marketing.
//
// Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
//
//   Yeah, nothing too wild here. I would like to find some sort of application or
//   plugin that will be a bit more responsive to my JS errors, however.
//
// chapter 1
// Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax
// with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.
//
//   Symbols for operators are mostly the same in both languages. ||, &&, and ! are
//   used in both.
//
//
//   Ruby conditionals behave pretty logically but JS can be used to
//   "short circuit." Both languages use the == operator to check eqaulity,
//   but JS has an additional === operator designed to compare "precise value."
//
//
